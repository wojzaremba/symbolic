We have presented automatic method of polynomial formulas discovery. Method itself is novel, as well 
as derived results of partition function approximation are unexpected.
There are three major directions of future research. First, concerns with computation of partition function,
its derivatives, using approximation for learning, 
approximations of deep Bolzmann machine, optimization of derived formulas, and 
understanding mathematical principles behind formulas derived by our programs. Second, is in 
learning how to generalize computation, and replace current brute force process with something more
intelligent. E.g. We could generalize computation of $g(x \rightarrow x^k, W)$ for $k = 1, \dots, 5$ to
$k > 5$. Finally, the third direction are real-world applictions of this framework on large code
databases. We could automatically detect parts of code with expressions that have suboptimal time complexity
and replace them.
