We have presented an automatic method for docvery of polynomial
formulas. The method itself is novel, as well as the derived
approximations to the RBM partition function.  There are three
major directions of future research. The first is concerned with computing
the partition function and its derivatives, using approximations for
learning, approximations for deep Bolzmann machines, optimization of
the derived formulas, and understanding the mathematical principles behind
formulas derived by our programs. The second would be to use learning to
generalize computation, i.e.~replace current brute force process with
something more intelligent. E.g. We could generalize computation of
$g(x \rightarrow x^k, W)$ for $k = 1, \dots, 5$ to $k > 5$. Finally,
the third direction are real-world applictions of this framework on
large code databases. We could automatically detect parts of code with
expressions that have suboptimal time complexity and replace them.
