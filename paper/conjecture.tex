We present our believes on hardness of approximation of partition function. 
We were not able to prove, or disprove conjectures presented in this chapter.
\begin{conjecture}
Linear combination of terms for a matrix $W$ generated by use of rules defined on Figure \ref{rules}.
consists of $g(x \rightarrow x^k, W)$. Moreover, size of generated grammar
up to degree $k$ is exponential in $k$.
\label{simple}
\end{conjecture}

Corollary and all implications assumes that Conjecture \ref{simple} is valid.

\begin{corollary}
	$g(x \rightarrow k, W)$
	can be computed in exponential time in $k$, but in $O(n^3)$ time with respect to size of $W$ ($W$ is of size $n \times n$).
\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma}
	For $x < C$, $e^x$ can be approximated up to $\epsilon$ accuracy in log scale with $\frac{Ce}{\epsilon}$ terms. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

For every $x < C$ there exists $t < x$, such that :  
\begin{align*}
	e^x = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \dots + \frac{x^{k - 1}}{(k - 1)!} + \frac{x^k}{k!}e^t
\end{align*}
This implies
\begin{align*}
	|e^x - (1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \dots + \frac{x^{k - 1}}{(k - 1)!}) | < \frac{C^k}{k!}e^C \\
	\sim \exp(k\log{C} + C - k\log{k} + k) < \epsilon
\end{align*}

We require that 
\begin{align*}
	k (1 + \log{C} - \log{k}) < \log{\epsilon} - C \\ 
	k (\log{Ce} - \log{k}) < \log{\epsilon} - C
\end{align*}

Let's assume, that $\log{\epsilon} < -1$, and $1 - Ce < -C$. This assumptions are valid if $\epsilon$ is small
enough, and $C$ is large enough.


For such $\epsilon$ and $C$, and $k > \frac{Ce}{\epsilon}$, above inequalities are fullfied :
\begin{align*}
	\frac{Ce}{\epsilon} (\log{Ce} - \log{\frac{Ce}{\epsilon}}) < \log{\epsilon} - C \\
	\frac{Ce}{\epsilon} \log{\epsilon} < \log{\epsilon} - C\\
	C < \log{\epsilon}(1 - \frac{Ce}{\epsilon})
\end{align*}

This implies that for bounded by $C$ energy of RBMs, we can do up to $\epsilon$ approximation of partition function (in log scale) by using
$\frac{Ce}{\epsilon}$ terms of Taylor approximation. This algorithm assumes Conjecture \ref{simple} has complexity
$O(2^{\frac{Ce}{\epsilon}}n^3)$.

\end{proof}
