\section{Conjecture on Hardness of Partition Function Approximation}
Approximation of partition function is one of crucial problems in machine learning.
Above framework gave us some potential future solutions to this issue, as 
well as the intuition about how hard this problem is. This section assumes what we have
observed for $g(x \rightarrow x^k, W)$, and describes consequences on hardness of approximation.
We now present conjectures relating to the hardness of approximation
of the partition function. Unfortunately, thus far we are not able to prove, or disprove these conjectures.
\begin{conjecture}
  $g(x \rightarrow x^k, W)$ consists of a linear combination of terms
  for a matrix $W$ generated by use of rules defined in Figure
  \ref{rules}.  Furthermore, the size of the generated grammar up to degree $k$
  grows like $O(\lambda^k)$ for some constant $\lambda$.
\label{simple}
\end{conjecture}

The following corollary and lemma assumes that Conjecture \ref{simple} is valid.

\begin{corollary}
	$g(x \rightarrow x^k, W)$
	can be computed in exponential time in $k$, but in $O(n^3)$ time with respect to size of $W$ ($W$ is of size $n \times n$).
\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma}
	For $x < C$, $e^x$ can be approximated up to $\epsilon$ accuracy in log scale with $\frac{Ce}{\epsilon}$ terms. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

For every $x < C$ there exists $u < x$, such that:  
\begin{align*}
	e^x = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \dots + \frac{x^{k - 1}}{(k - 1)!} + \frac{x^k}{k!}e^u
\end{align*}
This implies
\begin{align*}
	|e^x - (1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \dots + \frac{x^{k - 1}}{(k - 1)!}) | < \frac{C^k}{k!}e^C \\
	\sim \exp(k\log{C} + C - k\log{k} + k) < \epsilon
\end{align*}

We require that: 
\begin{align*}
	k (1 + \log{C} - \log{k}) < \log{\epsilon} - C \\ 
	k (\log{Ce} - \log{k}) < \log{\epsilon} - C
\end{align*}

Let us assume that $\log{\epsilon} < -1$, and $1 - Ce < -C$. These assumptions are valid if $\epsilon$ is small
enough, and $C$ is large enough.


For such $\epsilon$ and $C$, and $k > \frac{Ce}{\epsilon}$, the
following inequalities are satisfied:
\begin{align*}
	\frac{Ce}{\epsilon} (\log{Ce} - \log{\frac{Ce}{\epsilon}}) < \log{\epsilon} - C \\
	\frac{Ce}{\epsilon} \log{\epsilon} < \log{\epsilon} - C\\
	C < \log{\epsilon}(1 - \frac{Ce}{\epsilon})
\end{align*}

This implies that is the energy of the RBM is bounded by $C$, we can
approximate it up to $\epsilon$ approximation of partition function
(in log scale) by using $\frac{Ce}{\epsilon}$ terms of the Taylor
approximation. This algorithm assumes Conjecture \ref{simple} has
complexity $O(\lambda^{\frac{Ce}{\epsilon}}n^3)$.

\end{proof}
